#1. Brand Identity Framework
##1) Brand Identyty Prism by Kaferer 

David Aaker, hailed as the Father of Modern Branding, defines brand identity as, “…a unique set of brand associations that the brand strategist aspires to create or maintain.”

Jeff Bezos, Amazon overlord and world’s filthy-richest man, puts it in slightly more colloquial terms: “Branding is what people say about you when you’re not in the room.”

These six facets are divided into two dimensions: (1) Picture of Sender vs. Picture of
Recipient –where **a well-presented brand should be able to be seen as a person** (Physique and
Personality) and also as the stereotypical user (Reflection and Self-image); and (2) Externalisation vs. Internalisation – where social aspects of a brand defining its external expression (Physique,
Relationship and Reflection) and the aspects incorporated into the brand itself (Personality, Culture and Self-image) are presented. (EURIB, 2009)

interdependencies of the brand elements. 
The core of the brand anatomy is formed by the essence; the brand personality to differentiate the brand within the market. The benefits in the second ring stand for the wants and needs of the customer that the brand needs to deliver. Finally the outer ring represents the actual attributes of the product.

[ORIGINS OF THE POLO SHIRT](https://www.theadairgroup.com/blog/2015/11/11/origins-of-the-polo-shirt/)
...
```René Lacoste, a seven-time Grand Slam tennis champion, found most shirts of the era to be uncomfortable and impractical. Additionally, tennis had become more competitive, and players were looking for ways to better their game. This included what they wore. Lacoste designed a shirt for tennis players with shorter sleeves and fewer buttons  down the front. The shirt was also made with pique cotton, a lightweight material that allowed the shirt to breathe and keep the players cool. The collars on these new shirts were unstarched and flat, allowing for a wider range of motion. After he had debuted the shirt at the 1926 US Open, it became so popular that he established the La Chemise Lacoste Company. By 1933, he was mass-marketing his shirts to the tennis community. Almost twenty years later, in 1951, Lacoste began manufacturing his shirts in a variety of colors other than the traditional white worn by tennis players. He started selling these shirts in high-end department stores, and they became a status symbol for any who could afford them. Soon, the short sleeved, soft-collared shirts produced for tennis and polo became known as the 'polo shirt'.```

Plan with the people
Begin with what they have
Build on what they know
Of the best leaders
When the task is accomplished
The people will remark
We have done it ourselves.”
